To calculate the distances I created a distance matrix since I thought that this was the easiest and fastest way since we only have to compute the distances once. In respect
to your comments on my last exercise, I tried to optimize my code as good as possible, when I tried it, it calculates the clusters within 2-4 seconds (timed it multiple times)

I used an additional function to adjust the dashboard, this way the code is a bit more readable I thought and since I couldn't find a statement that said it is forbidden to 
write additional functions I thought that this was fine.

I wasn't quite sure what the initial text of the div element should be, so I just came up with a random assignment, I hope that this is fine. It updates when one calculates
the clusters.
